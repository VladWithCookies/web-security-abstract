# Insecure URL Redirect

## Description
An attacker can successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials on the victim users by modifying the untrusted URL input to a malicious site.

## Prevention
Verify the URL that the user will be redirected or forwarded to, especially if the URL parameter can be changed or tampered on the client-side.
