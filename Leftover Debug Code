# Leftover Debug Code

## Description
Left Over Debug is ability to gain unauthorized access through functionality that was designed for debugging 
or testing proposes and not intended for external access.

## Prevention
* Add conditional variables to remove debugging code when deploying in production and staging environments
* Remove developer comments that reference sensitive information including internal URL's, API endpoints or test credentials before deploying the application
* Protect application staging and test environments by restricting their access to specific IP ranges or addresses, thereby preventing search engines such as Google from discovering and indexing these assets
